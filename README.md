# API-consume
This is a project where I'm using an API called "BoredApi" (https://www.boredapi.com/). The API provides random activity ideas for users to do when they are bored.
I designed a fictitious name and logo for a website that sells courses or coupons for various activities. The website includes a page with a button to generate random activity ideas.

The website and responsive design is as follows:
